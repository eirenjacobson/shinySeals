This folder contains code to simulate a population of harbour seals. It is designed to emulate the population at Scapa Flow, Orkney, Scotland, which has experienced an apparent decline. Vital rates (fecundity, pup, juvenile, and adult male and female survival) can be set by the user and modified in order to visualize the impact on the population. Real count data are available to plot. 

To run the app, execute the file "app.R"

Required packages (all available on CRAN).
